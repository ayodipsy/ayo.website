<h2>About the lions</h2>
<p>The lion <strong>(Panthera leo)</strong> is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; 
a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
 It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt 
 together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt
 humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

 <h4>CHARACTERISTICS OF A LION</h4>
 <p>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes.
 The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe
 the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. 
 In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals
 or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres<strong>(6–7 feet)</strong>long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder
 and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 
 120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually 
 darker than the rest of the coat.</p>

 <h5>REPRODUCTION AND LIFE CYCLE OF A LION</h5>
 <p>Both sexes are polygamous and breed throughout the year, but females are usually restricted to the one or two adult males of their pride.
 In captivity lions often breed every year, but in the wild they usually breed no more than once in two years. Females are receptive to mating for three or 
 four days within a widely variable reproductive cycle. During this time a pair generally mates every 20–30 minutes, with up to 50 copulations per 24 hours. 
 Such extended copulation not only stimulates ovulation in the female but also secures paternity for the male by excluding other males. The gestation period 
 is about 108 days, and the litter size varies from one to six cubs, two to four being usual.</p>
